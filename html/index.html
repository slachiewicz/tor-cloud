	      <h2>Tor bridges in the Amazon cloud</h2>
	    </hgroup>

<p>As of May 8, 2015, the <a href="https://cloud.torproject.org/">Tor Cloud project</a> has been discontinued.</p>

<p>The Tor Cloud project gave people a user-friendly way of deploying bridges on the Amazon EC2 cloud computing platform to help users access an uncensored Internet. By setting up a bridge, they would donate bandwidth to the Tor network and help improve the safety and speed at which users can access the Internet.</p>

<p>The main reason for discontinuing Tor Cloud is the fact that software requires maintenance, and Tor Cloud is no exception.  There is at least one <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/14073">major bug in the Tor Cloud image</a> that makes it completely dysfunctional (meaning that users could not use this particular service to access the Internet), and there are <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=!closed&component=Tor+Cloud">over a dozen other bugs</a>, at least one of them of highest priority.  Probably as a result of these bugs, the number of Tor Cloud bridges has <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/cloudbridges.html?graph=cloudbridges&start=2011-04-27&end=2015-04-27">steadily declined since early 2014</a>.</p>

<p>We have tried to find a new maintainer for Tor Cloud for months, but without success.  There have been offers to send us patches, but we couldn't find a Tor person to review and approve them.  We encourage everyone who stepped up to start their own cloud bridges project under another name ("<a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/trademark-faq.html.en">Onion Cloud</a>"?), possibly forking the <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-cloud.git/">existing Tor Cloud code</a> that will remain available.  Tor Cloud is still a good idea, it just needs somebody to implement it.</p>

<p>Or maybe this is a good opportunity for the community to further look into other approaches for providing an easy-to-deploy bridge or relay, like <a href="https://github.com/david415/ansible-tor">Ansible Tor</a> or <a href="https://github.com/glamrock/cirrus">cirrus</a>.</p>

<p>If people still want to help users access an uncensored Internet, there remain <a href="https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en">plenty of ways to help</a>.  For example, it's still possible to spin up an instance on Amazon EC2 or any other cloud computing platform and install a Tor bridge manually.  Or people can donate to organizations that run Tor relays and bridges like <a href="https://www.torservers.net/">Torservers.net</a> or their <a href="https://www.torservers.net/partners.html">partner organizations</a>.</p>

<p>Note that discontinuing the Tor Cloud project has no effect on existing Tor Cloud instances.  Whenever one of those instances was started, a template of the operating system and settings was copied, and removing the template has no effect on the copies.</p>

<p>Sorry for any inconvenience caused by this.</p>

	<p>The Tor Cloud project gives you a user-friendly way of deploying
	bridges to help users access an uncensored Internet. By setting up a
	bridge, you donate bandwidth to the Tor network and help improve the
	safety and speed at which users can access the Internet. <a

	    <p>This project runs on the Amazon EC2 cloud computing
	    platform, which powers Amazon.com and other major websites. Amazon
	    EC2 allows users to launch their own virtual machines and computing
	    resources with flexible and cost-effective terms. <a
		    href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/"
	    target="_blank">Learn more about Amazon EC2 &raquo;</a></p>
	<p>Setting up a Tor bridge on Amazon EC2 is simple and will only take
	you a couple of minutes. The images have been configured with automatic
	package updates and port forwarding, so you do not have to worry about
	Tor not working or the server not getting security updates.

	      <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
	    </hgroup>
        <p>To help new customers get started in the cloud, Amazon has
        introduced a free usage tier. The Tor Cloud images are all
        micro instances, and new customers can run a micro instance for 
        free for a whole year. The AWS free usage tier also includes 15
        GB of bandwidth out per month.</p>

        <p>The Tor Cloud images have been configured to use no more than
        40 GB of bandwidth out per month. We have <a
            href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5358#comment:1">estimated</a> 
        that customers who do not qualify for the free usage tier will 
        pay up to $20 a month for an instance located in us-east-1
        (Virginia). </p>
        <p>Customers who qualify for the free usage
        tier, but who run bridges that use more than 15 GB of bandwidth
        out per month, will pay up to $3 per month for an instance
        located in us-east-1 (Virginia).
        </p>

        <p>
        The cost of running a bridge in the Amazon cloud depends on the region you put it in.

<!--
<div id="faq" class="main" role="main">
	<hgroup>
	<div class="deco first"></div>
	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
	</hgroup>

    <p><b>0. Private bridge or obfsproxy bridge?</b><br>
    If you set up a private bridge, your bridge will not tell the bridge
    authority that it exists. You will have to manually give out your bridge
    address to users.
    </p>

        <p><b>1. How much does it cost?</b><br>
    	There is no fee charged by the Tor Project, Inc for you to run a
        Tor Cloud image. Amazon does, however, charge instances according to their <a
        href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/">pricing</a>. See
    <em>How much does it cost?</em> on the <a
        href="https://cloud.torproject.org/">front page</a> for more
    information.</p>

    <p><b>2. The instance is running, what's next?</b><br>
    You should not have to do anything once the instance is up and
    running. Tor will start up as a bridge and confirm that it is reachable
    from the outside. If you have set up an obfsproxy bridge, then it will also
    tell the bridge authority that it exists, and the address for your
    bridge will be given out to users.</p>

    <p><b>3. How do I find the address of my bridge?</b><br>
    To find the address of your bridge, log on to the AWS Management
    Console, find your instance, and click on it. The bottom half of the
    page will show some details about the instance you have selected,
    including <em>Public DNS</em>. If the AWS Management Console says
    that the <em>Public DNS</em> for your instance is
    <em>ec2-192-0-2-27.compute-1.amazonaws.com</em>, then you know that the IP
    address is <em>192.0.2.27</em>. All of the bridges run on port 443, so the
    address of your bridge is <em>192.0.2.27:443</em>. Obfsproxy bridges will
    also run on port 52176.</p>

    <p><b>4. How can I check if my bridge is running?</b><br>
    There are two ways you can check to see if your bridge is running;
    you can either log on to the instance and check
    <em>/var/log/tor/log</em>, or you can use Tor and connect to your
    own bridge. For instructions on how to use a bridge with Tor, see
    the <a
        href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en">Tor
        Project website</a>.</p>

	<p><b>5. I can't connect as user <i>root</i>, what's wrong?</b><br>
	When you right-click and choose <i>connect</i>, AWS will suggest that
	you use <i>root</i> as the username. This is wrong. You need to use
	<i>ubuntu</i> as the username if you wish to connect to your server via
	SSH.</p>

    <p><b>6. How do I stop or terminate the instance?</b><br>
    To stop or terminate the instance, log on to the AWS Management
    Console, find your instance, right click on it and choose either
    "Stop" or "Terminate". "Stop" will just shutdown the instance as
    normal and will allow you to start it up again later. "Terminate"
    will delete the instance from your AWS account.</p>

    <p><b>7. How do I change the IP address of my instance?</b><br>
    To change the IP address of your instance, log on to the AWS
    Management Console, find your instance, right click on it and choose
    "Stop". Once the instance has shut down completely, right click on
    it again and choose "Start". The instance will be assigned a new IP
    address when it starts up again.</p> 

    <p><b>8. What is arm and how do I use it?</b><br>
    The <em>anonymizing relay monitor (arm)</em> is a terminal status
    monitor for Tor. This works much like <em>top</em> does for system
    usage, providing real time statistics for bandwidth, cpu, memory
    usage, current Tor configuration, connection details etc. To run
    arm, connect to your instance with SSH and run <em>sudo -u
        debian-tor arm</em>. You can read more about arm <a
        href="http://www.atagar.com/arm/">here</a>.</p>

	<p><b>9. What's in the Tor configuration file?</b><br>
    Here's the configuration for an <a
    href="https://cloud.torproject.org/obfstorrc.txt">obfsproxy bridge</a> and a <a
    href="https://cloud.torproject.org/privtorrc.txt">private bridge</a>. The following packages are installed when you start a Tor Cloud instance: tor, tor-geoipdb, tor-arm, deb.torproject.org-keyring, obfsproxy.
    </p>

	<p><b>10. Will the images automatically download and install package updates?</b><br>
	Yes, the images have all been configured with the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates"><i>unattended-upgrades</i></a> package. This means that your system will automatically download and install updates.</p>

	<p><b>11. Will you let me know when you publish new images?</b><br>
	New cloud images will be announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/torproject">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://identi.ca/torproject">identi.ca</a>, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org">our blog</a> and on the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk">tor-talk</a> mailing list.</p>

	<p><b>12. Where do I report a bug I am encountering?</b><br>
	If you think the bug you have found is specific to the Tor Cloud
	images we provide, please <a href="https://trac.torproject.org">file a bug</a> or
	send an email to <i>help AT rt.torproject.org</i>.</p>

	<p><b>13. Is there an IRC channel where I can ask about Tor Cloud?</b><br>
	Yes, simply join #tor on irc.oftc.net and ask your question. It may take a while before we get back to you, so please be patient.</p>

	<p><b>14. I have a question that is not answered here, what do I do?</b><br>
	Please send an email to <i>help AT rt.torproject.org</i>.</p>
