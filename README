The Tor Cloud Project is a collaboration between Expression Technologies
and the Tor Project, Inc. The goal of this project is to provide
bridge-by-default images for Amazon EC2.

All tickets related to this project can be found under the "Tor Cloud"
component on trac.torproject.org.

The code was hosted by Expression Tech on github.com/inf0/Tor-Cloud/,
but was moved to gitweb.torproject.org/tor-cloud.git on October 8, 2011.
